## Usage
### Option 1 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-%20New-brightgreen)
GRUnlocker will attempt to find the default save file location.
Will display "Save Path: Auto" if successfully found the save file.

#### Option 2 (Easiest)
Copy GRUnlocker.exe to the save directory and run it from there.

### Starting arguments
```-displaypath``` > Will display the current save file path which it is working with.

## GR save file location
### Windows (Steam/GOG)
```%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ghostrunner\Saved\SavedGames\<long-number>\Ghostrunner.sav```
### Windows (Epic Games Store)
```%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ghostrunner\Saved\SavedGames\GhostrunnerSave.sav```
### Linux
```<steamfolder>/steamapps/compatdata/1139900/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/Ghosteamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/Ghostrunner/Saved/SaveGames/<long-number>/Ghostrunner.sav```

## Who it is aimed at?
Mostly for players that finished the game and want to practice or speedrun the game with their favorite katanas or specific progress unlocked.
Or people which lost their save files and want to recover from where they've left.

If you haven't finished the game nor collected all the collectibles beforehand.. I'll highly recommend doing so.

## Disclaimer
Make sure you backup your .save file before you run the program! (just in case).
I'm not responsible for any progress loss or/and achievements completions, so keep a backup prior to using it.

### Speedrunning
Please note that New-Game modifications (collectibles unlocked or custom sword) are not allowed for use during full runs at this time.
However, you're allowed to do ILs(Individual Levels) with it.

### Achievements
The GRUnlocker may and **will** trigger different achievements, you have been warned!
So if you want to get those achievements, you should do it by yourself.
