Mostly for players that finished the game and want to practice or speedrun the game with their favorite katanas.
If you haven't finished the game nor collected all the collectibles beforehand.. I'll highly recommend to do so.

This program/script does not guarantee you'll receive the corresponded achievements if any at all, so if you want to get those achievements, you should do it yourself.
